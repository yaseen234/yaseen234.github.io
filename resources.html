    <h1> Handouts </h1>
<p> Handouts are very valuable in the olympiad community because topics are broken down by fellow highschoolers in a more understandable manner. From 
  the topics I've learnt, I've made notes that could technically be considered handouts. I've also made handouts for math club lectures I've taken </p> 
    <p> Derivation of Potential due to Electric Dipole <a href="Potential_due_to_dipole.pdf">pdf</a>. </p>
<p> Derivation of Power Dissipated in an LCR Circuit <a href="Power.pdf">pdf</a>. </p>
    <h3> Math Club Material</h3>
    <p>Vieta's Relations <a href="Vieta_s_Relations.pdf">Slides</a>.</p>
 <p>Logarithms <a href="Log_Presentation.pdf">Slides</a> <a href="Laws_of_logarithms.pdf">Handout</a></p>

    <p> Introduction to Modular Arithmetic <a href="mod_arithmetic.pdf"> Slides</a>

    <h1> Book Recommendations (Under Construction) </h1>
    <p> Disclaimer: these are academic book recommendations, and not books read for leisure (unless learning is leisure for you!). That said, here are some of my favorite books in each science (except chemistry because I've never got the hang of it). </p>
    <h3> Biology </h3>
    <h4> Campbell Biology </h4>
<p> You cannot be a biology olympiad aspirant without reading this book entirely. Campbell Biology, now in its 12th edition summarizes (with some decent depth) all fields of biology in one volume. It lays the foundation for further biological studies. It has numerous diagrams and easy-to-understand explanations. There is an emphasis on inferring the content from experiments. Would recommend this book for anyone looking for a solid base in biology</p>
    <p> The biology books I've read are for olympiad purposes. </p>
    <h3> Physics </h3>
